# Neutral (Abstract Object)
experimental kernel addition for supercollider. It demonstrates what can be done with a basic object that understands almost nothing. 

The `Neutral` class should some day be a built in class, this implementation is a hack. In the Ruby language, there is a class `BasicObject`.

Possible name alternatives for classes once included in sclang could be:

`AbstractObject` (now Neutral)
`Lazy` (now Fexpr)
